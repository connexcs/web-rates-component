# ConnexCS Web Rates Component

This component / snippet is a simple example of how you can load the public rates from your ConnexCS switch to your website.


## Step 1. (Include the JS File)
```
<script src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/connexcs/web-rates-component/master/connexcs-rates.js'></script>
```
*Its not recommended to use raw.github to host production content, but this shows you how to get started*


## Step 2. (Add the HTML Element Placeholder)
```
<div id="connexcs_rates" domain="portal.mydomain.com"></div>
```
*Remember to replace `portal.mydomain.com` with whatever customer portal you have setup with ConnexCS*
